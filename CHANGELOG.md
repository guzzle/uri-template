# Changelog

All notable changes to `uri-template` will be documented in this file.

Updates should follow the [Keep a CHANGELOG](http://keepachangelog.com/) principles.

## v2.0.0 - 2026-07-20

### Changed

- Invalid URI template syntax now throws `InvalidArgumentException` instead of expanding partially
- Literal template text is now validated and valid non-ASCII literals are pct-encoded
- URI template variable names and modifiers are now validated according to RFC 6570
- Prefix modifiers are now rejected for list and map values
- Referenced variable values are now validated before expansion
- Dense zero-indexed arrays are expanded as lists and sparse or mixed-key arrays as maps
- `UriTemplate` is now non-instantiable; use `UriTemplate::expand()` statically
- Nested null values in lists and maps are now treated as undefined members and omitted
- Variable values must now be valid UTF-8; invalid byte sequences throw `InvalidArgumentException`
- Booleans now expand as `1` and `0` at every nesting level
- Non-finite floats now throw `InvalidArgumentException` instead of expanding as `INF` or `NAN`
- Non-empty lists whose members are all null are now treated as defined variables
- Variable specifier whitespace padding is now detected with the real whitespace set
- `UriTemplate` now rejects native PHP serialization and unserialization
- Referenced variable values are now detached and formed before expansion begins
- Template syntax is now validated for every expression before variable values are formed
- Stringable objects are now converted to strings once per value position while values are formed
- Invalid UTF-8 in variable values and map keys is now rejected while values are formed
- Finite floats are now converted to their expansion strings while values are formed
- Exceptions thrown by `__toString()` now surface while values are formed, before any output exists

### Fixed

- Fixed invalid template expressions being accepted as query and path-style parameter names
- Fixed prefix modifiers counting bytes instead of Unicode code points and pct-encoded triplets
- Fixed unsupported variable shapes producing warnings, conversion errors, or `Array` output
- Fixed path-style parameter explode rendering empty members as `name=` instead of bare `name`
- Fixed map keys not using the operator's allow set under reserved and fragment expansion
- Fixed map explode rendering empty members as `name=` instead of bare `name` for unnamed operators
- Fixed the documented variables array type rejecting integer keys for numeric variable names
- Fixed all-null maps throwing with prefix modifiers instead of being skipped as undefined
- Fixed prefix modifiers splitting Unicode code points encoded as multiple pct-encoded triplets
- Fixed path-style composites rendering bare `name` instead of `name=` for empty joined members
- Fixed null nested query array members being rejected for their keys instead of being omitted
- Fixed float values expanding with the locale decimal separator on PHP versions before 8.0
- Fixed PCRE engine failures on very long variable names being reported as invalid template syntax
- Fixed invalid UTF-8 errors for list and map members not reporting the member path
- Fixed exception messages embedding raw controls or malformed UTF-8 from expressions and map keys
- Fixed invalid UTF-8 in literal text reported at the segment offset, not the first invalid byte
- Fixed PCRE engine failures during literal text validation being reported as invalid UTF-8
- Fixed PCRE engine failures during variable UTF-8 validation not being reported as runtime errors
- Fixed PCRE engine failures during invalid UTF-8 offset recovery being reported as invalid UTF-8
